# Test Management System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the complete test management system for the UEM Placement Platform, including test creation, retrieval, submission, and evaluation endpoints.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Test Routes (`test_routes.py`)
Created a comprehensive Flask blueprint with the following endpoints:

#### Test Creation
- **POST /api/tests/generate/{company}**
  - Generates new tests for specified companies
  - Integrates with QuestionGenerationService
  - Supports parameters: num_questions, year, force_regenerate
  - Returns test metadata and configuration

#### Test Retrieval
- **GET /api/tests/{test_id}**
  - Retrieves test questions for taking tests
  - Supports question randomization
  - Section filtering capability
  - Admin-only answer inclusion
  - Tracks user attempt history

#### Test Submission
- **POST /api/tests/{test_id}/submit**
  - Processes test submissions
  - Calculates scores and percentages
  - Evaluates answers against correct responses
  - Updates progress metrics by section
  - Stores detailed attempt records

#### Company Management
- **GET /api/tests/companies**
  - Lists available companies
  - Shows test statistics per company
  - Indicates supported vs custom companies

#### Results Retrieval
- **GET /api/tests/{test_id}/results/{attempt_id}**
  - Retrieves detailed test results
  - Shows question-by-question analysis
  - Provides section-wise performance breakdown
  - Includes explanations and correct answers

### 2. Authentication Integration
- All endpoints protected with JWT authentication
- Uses `jwt_required_custom()` decorator
- Integrates with existing auth middleware
- Supports both session and token-based auth

### 3. Database Integration
- Seamless integration with existing models
- Proper foreign key relationships
- Transaction management with rollback on errors
- Progress metrics tracking and updates

### 4. Error Handling
- Comprehensive error responses with structured JSON
- Specific error codes for different failure types
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Detailed logging for debugging

### 5. Testing Infrastructure
Enhanced test setup with:
- **test_setup.py**: Helper functions for test app creation
- **test_simple_endpoints.py**: Basic endpoint functionality tests
- **test_generation_simple.py**: Complete workflow testing
- **test_test_endpoints.py**: Comprehensive pytest test suite

## Key Features Implemented

### Test Generation
